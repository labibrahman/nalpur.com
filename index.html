    <h3>Nalpur uses a B2B platform to connect apparel brands with manufacturers.</h3>
    <p>The Nalpur Platform comprises three things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An aggregated list of fully vetted factories with available capacity and price estimates for manufacturing clothing.</li>
        <li>Order management software that simplifies the process of creating samples, sending feedback, and placing a purchase order.</li>
        <li>Supply chain management software that tracks the shipment of the product and handles the transfer of funds to the manufacturer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We haven&#8217;t built the platform yet. Before we commit to building it, we&#8217;re fulfilling orders the old-fashioned way &mdash; over phone and email &mdash; so that we can better automate the process when we do build it. </p>
    <p>Nalpur is cheaper than existing suppliers because we are working with factories in Bangladesh that are more cost effective than ones based in China, Vietnam or India.</p>
    <p>To start working with Nalpur, all you need is a tech pack with your product specifications and target price. We will release this information only to factories that meet both your requirements and international labor standards. Once you agree to a price and an order quantity, we will guide you through the manufacturing process till your shipment arrives in the US. </p>
